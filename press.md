## Short description
The ClojureScript Visual Cheatsheet is designed to learn Clojure(Script) functions with reduced cognitive load using visual examples.

## Detailed description
The ClojureScript Visual Cheatsheet aims to explain Clojure(Script) functions in a mostly visual way. It reduces cognitive load by representing data as colored primitive shapes, making it easy to grasp a function's purpose quickly. You can focus on the function structure by having the example data perceptibly distinguished from the syntax.
