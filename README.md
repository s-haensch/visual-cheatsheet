# The ClojureScript Visual Cheatsheet

This project aims to explain Clojure(Script) functions in a mostly visual way. It reduces cognitive load by representing data as colored primitive shapes, making it easy to grasp a function's purpose quickly. You can focus on the function structure by having the example data perceptibly distinguished from the syntax.

See the application on [github pages](https://s-haensch.github.io/visual-cheatsheet/).



## Roadmap

The ClojureScript Visual Cheatsheet (**TCVC**) is still early stage and as of now simply a proof of concept. Here are the things to be implemented next:

- [ ] covering all core Clojure functions
- [ ] making it responsive
- [ ] filtering / search bar
- [ ] highlight function arguments explained in the description text as in [this prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/O5Pgq4suWnaAK0KjWyqOtqxb/ClojureScript-Visual-Cheatsheet?node-id=125%3A4255&scaling=contain)

## Design
If you are interested in the design / prototype process, you can have a look at the [figma source file](https://www.figma.com/file/O5Pgq4suWnaAK0KjWyqOtqxb/ClojureScript-Visual-Cheatsheet).


## Press
If you want to report about TCVC, your first choice would be to post a link to the [github page](https://s-haensch.github.io/visual-cheatsheet/), it already has all the Open Graph and Twitter meta information. For all other purposes, see the **press resources**.
